I enjoy figuring out how data moves from raw and messy to useful and understandable.\nRight now, I mostly work with Python and SQL, and spend a lot of time around tools like Airflow, Spark, dbt, Parquet, and Arrow. I like systems that are simple, reproducible, and don’t surprise you at 3am.\nWhen I’m not working with data, I’m either at the pool, catching up on sleep, or convincing myself I’ll only watch one episode."
