    "text": "Hi, I’m Kashish 👋\nI’m a Statistics student at UBC who likes working with data - cleaning it, analyzing it, building things with it, and occasionally wondering why it’s broken in the first place.\nI’ve spent time across data science, analytics, and data engineering, working on projects in healthcare, government, and large companies. I enjoy figuring out how data moves from raw and messy to useful and understandable.\nRight now, I mostly work with Python and SQL, and spend a lot of time around tools like Airflow, Spark, dbt, Parquet, and Arrow. I like systems that are simple, reproducible, and don’t surprise you at 3am.\nWhen I’m not working with data, I’m either at the pool, catching up on sleep, or convincing myself I’ll only watch one episode.\n\n\nQuick Facts\n\n📍 Vancouver, Canada\n\n🎓 BSc in Statistics @ UBC\n\n🧠 GPA: 4.0 / 4.33\n\n👨‍🏫 Stats TA\n\n🍵 Tea enthusiast"
