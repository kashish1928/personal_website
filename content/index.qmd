## Hi, I’m Kashish 👋

I’m a **Statistics undergraduate at UBC** and a **Data Engineer** with experience designing and scaling
data platforms across healthcare, government research, and large-scale enterprise systems.

My interests sit at the intersection of:

- Data engineering & analytics infrastructure
- Distributed systems and cloud platforms
- Reproducible research and data quality
- Privacy-aware data pipelines

Currently, I work with **Airflow, Spark, dbt, Parquet, and Arrow** to build reliable, production-grade pipelines.
