## What I Do Outside of Work & School

### 🏋️‍♂️ Fitness & Sports
I love staying active and trying new things. My favorites are:  
- Swimming 🏊‍♂️ — nothing like the calm of the water to reset your brain  
- Running 🏃‍♂️ — Vancouver runs are the best therapy  
- A little bit of every sport I can get my hands on 🏀⚽🎾 — keeps things fun and unpredictable


### 🍿 Shows & Movies
I’m a **binge-watcher at heart**. My current favorites:

**Shows:**  
- *Stranger Things* — suspense, mystery, and 80s nostalgia all rolled into one  
- *Modern Family* — hilarious, heartwarming, and perfectly relatable  

**Movies:**  
- *F1: The movie* — fast cars, big drama, and real-life racing chaos  
- *Bhool Bhulaiyaa* — twists, thrills, and a touch of spookiness  
- *Crazy, Stupid, Love* — romance, humor, and awkwardly perfect moments

Some personal picks I’d recommend:

- *Byculla to Bangkok* — a gripping true story with incredible storytelling  
- *Wealthy Barber Returns* — fun, practical personal finance advice  
- *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* — magic, nostalgia, and timeless adventure


### 💰 Personal Finance
I enjoy **learning about investing, budgeting, and planning for the future**. It’s surprisingly fun when you see ideas actually work in real life!

You'd often find me on investopedia or reddit browsing r/personalFinanceCanada

### 🏎️ Formula 1
 
I enjoy the mix of speed, strategy, and engineering, and every race has me hoping, laughing, and occasionally facepalming (life of a Ferrari supporter).
